#### Author: enrightcw

This homework was about writing the backend for a workout tracker.  Our goal was to take in data and populate a mongoDB through mongoose usage.  Currently we have no way to link it to a live deployment with Heroku support not available and MLA support being down.  It will need to be cloned and run locally, or please see the link for a video of the app at work.
